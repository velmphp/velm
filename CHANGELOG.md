# Changelog

All notable changes to the Velm monorepo are documented here. Packagist packages (`velmphp/*`) share releases tagged from this repository.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`header_actions` / `page_actions`** — arch-declared toolbar buttons; `variant(ActionVariant)` colors; `form()` inline schema or `formView()` stored view; ACL via `perm`
- **Demo action endpoints** — `/web/demo/partners/*` wired from partners views (load demo data, export CSV/JSON, duplicate)
- **Geo import action** — `/web/geo/import` loads full geography (countries, states, cities) from public APIs on demand; bootstrap seed installs only the current country (IP geolocation, overridable via `VELM_GEO_COUNTRY`)
- **`res.currency`** — base module currency model with reference seeder, company `currency_id`, Settings → Currencies UI, and `VELM_DEFAULT_CURRENCY` bootstrap default
- **`res.currency.rate`** — company-scoped exchange rates with demo bootstrap rates; countries link to `res.currency` via `currency_id` (geo import/seeding auto-creates missing currencies)
- **Company setup** — contact/address fields, curated font picker + Google Fonts theming per company (`CompanyFonts`), color picker for primary accent, and complete branding form sections (PyVelm-aligned)
- **Company country bootstrap** — default company gets `country_id` from geo seed; `VELM_DEFAULT_CURRENCY` overrides currency, otherwise the bootstrap country's currency is used (i18n hook)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-07

First **stable** Velm release — installable from Packagist without `-s rc`, with docs and constraints aligned to `^1.0`.

### Changed

- **Stable Packagist** — `composer create-project velmphp/app my_app` resolves `velmphp/*` at **`^1.0`** (no release-candidate flag required)
- **Documentation** — stable install guides, computed fields / mixins / OR-domain coverage, production runbook; Docusaurus snapshot **`1.0.0`** as default docs version
- **Test coverage** — monorepo enforces **95%** line coverage in CI (`composer test:coverage:report`)

### Install

```bash
composer create-project velmphp/app my_app
cd my_app && composer run setup
```

## [1.0.0-rc3] - 2026-06-05

Last release candidate before stable **1.0.0** — full Tier 2 parity, analytics views, geo reference data, and attachment field widgets.

### Added

- **Computed fields** — `@depends` / `depends()` with stored and unstored compute paths; list/form read includes computed values
- **Domain OR-groups** — `\|`, `&`, `!` prefix notation for search domains and record rules
- **`$mixins`** — abstract model registration (e.g. `mail.thread` via `$mixins = ['mail.thread']`)
- **O2M inline/table widgets** — opt-in `widget('inline')` / `widget('table')` on One2many fields
- **`file` / `files` widgets** — M2O/M2M `ir.attachment` pickers wired to the file library (`file_url` remains for Char URLs)
- **`velm:module:uninstall --drop-schema`** — optional dev-only schema cleanup on uninstall
- **Analytics views** — `KanbanView`, `GraphView`, `PivotView` arch types; `Recordset::readGroup()`; stored routes and ApexCharts graph/pivot pages
- **`geo_data` module** — continents, countries, states, cities; `res.country` on base; partner country relations
- **Production ops guide** — cron, attachments disk, MySQL/Postgres notes (`website/docs/guides/production.md`)
- **CI DB matrix** — MySQL and Postgres dialect smoke jobs alongside SQLite

### Fixed

- **Extended model fields in UI** — list/form/M2O resolution uses registry `fieldSet()` so `$inherit` extensions (e.g. `country_id` on `partners_ext`) render correctly
- **O2M inverse writes** — `Recordset::writeO2m` uses merged field set for comodel columns
- **List toolbar z-index** — search dropdown no longer covers shell menu dropdowns
- **Multi file picker** — “Use selected” closes parent dialog from iframe context

### Install

```bash
composer create-project velmphp/app my_app v1.0.0-rc3 -s rc
cd my_app && composer run setup
```

## [1.0.0-rc2] - 2026-06-05

Packagist-installable RC2 — fixes RC1 publishing issues, MIT license, and documented install flags.

### Fixed

- **Packagist RC indexing** — removed `"version"` from library `composer.json` files (tag `v1.0.0-rc1` conflicted with `"version": "1.0.0"`)
- **`create-project` stability** — RC installs require `-s rc` or an explicit `v1.0.0-rc2` pin until stable `1.0.0`
- **Monorepo lock leak** — dropped path-repo `composer.lock` from `velmphp/app`; dependencies resolve from Packagist after RC tags index (run [`scripts/regenerate-app-lock.sh`](./scripts/regenerate-app-lock.sh) post-tag for a pinned lock)

### Changed

- **License:** LGPL-3.0-or-later → **MIT** (all `velmphp/*` packages and `velmphp/app`)
- Library inter-package constraints: `^1.0@dev` (`prefer-stable` picks RC tags on Packagist; path-repo monorepo dev uses `dev-main`)

### Install

```bash
composer create-project velmphp/app my_app v1.0.0-rc2 -s rc
cd my_app && composer run setup
```

## [1.0.0-rc1] - 2026-06-05

First public release candidate — installable from Packagist, documented dev reset, and split mirror publishing.

### Added

- **`velmphp/app`** — minimal greenfield Laravel host (`composer create-project velmphp/app`)
- **`velm:migrate:fresh`** — drop Velm schema and reinstall bootstrap modules
- **`velm:seed`** — module-scoped seeders via manifest `SEEDERS`
- Runtime autoloading for `addons/` (no per-module Composer PSR-4)
- Model auto-discovery from `models/` with topological registration order
- Packagist mirror split workflow (`splitsh-lite` → nine `velmphp/*` repos)
- Monorepo **`apps/demo`** reference app with demo addons (`demo_relations`, `change_management`, …)

### Changed

- Published app template split from demo: **`apps/app`** (Packagist) vs **`apps/demo`** (monorepo only)
- Inter-package constraints: `^1.0@RC`
- App lock files pinned for PHP 8.3 (Symfony 7.4)

### Install

```bash
composer create-project velmphp/app my_app -s rc
cd my_app && composer run setup
```
